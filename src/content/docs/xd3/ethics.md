## Ethics

> Carefully concidering the **rights**, **wellfare** and **dignity** of people involved in your research.

> Applies to how you conduct your research and how you handle data from clients.

### Core features

- A research project must **not cause harm** (physical, emotional or moral) to anyone.
- In your approach, you do everything with **respect and honor** for the other person.

### Three moral values

#### Be honest

- Not trying to elicit answers from anyone.
- Don't try to push anything in anyones mouth.
- Don't assume you know better than them, they are actually the expert on what you are questioning them about.
- No wrong answers, let the people speak.

#### Be sensitive

- Be aware of who you have in front of you and who you are yourself.
- Questions about poverty while wearing designer clothes and walking around with the latest Iphone.
- Sensitive topics: cultural beliefs, age, politics, racism,...

#### Be respectfull

- Don't ask anything you wouldn't tell a stranger yourself.
  - If so, let them project it on a fictional case.

### Why be ethical

#### 🔴 Don't ask about

- sexual orientation / history
- financial details / income
- medical details
- criminal records
- political preference
- intimate details about someone's life
- (off topic)

#### 🔴 Dont share

- personal information or pictures without permission
- make sure you cannot be held liable
- names

#### 🟢 Do tell people

- what you will research
- how the data will be used
- why you are talking to them
- who you are
- who the data will be shared with

#### 🟢 Do let them know

- That they should not answer if they don't want to.
- That they can leave the study wheneve they want.
- That there are no risks or benefits associated with the study.

### Asking for permission

#### Informed concent

> A document about distribution, privacy and trust in the research.

Ethical duty to ensure that your user research does **not harm** the people who participate in them.

> Informed concent does **not** equal an NDA (non-disclosure achievement).

### Dark patterns of user research

- Credulity
- Dogmatism
- Biases
- Obscurantism
- Laziness
- Vagueness
- Hubris

#### Credulity

> Asking users what they want and believing the answer without proper proof.

People don't have reliable insight into their mental processes, so there is no point in asking them what they want.

**So instead of listening to what people say, look at what they do.**

#### Biases

> Bias means a special influence that sways one's thinking especially in a way considered to be unfair.

There is more than **180 cognitive biases**.  
They can lead to **dark patterns**.

#### Vagueness

> If you do research only occasionally, you need to answer lots of questions. This means you end up learning a little about a lot.

With user research you actually want to learn a lot about a little.  
That '_little_' questions is the specific question that keeps you up at night.

#### Hubris

> Hubris means extreme pride or self-confidence.

You show off the results but no one is interested in them.

## Diversity and Inclusiveness (and regulations)

> is about involvement, representation and engagement

## Working with children, minors, elderly, disadvantaged groups, ...

### COPRA (Children't Online Privacy Protection Act)

**Prohibiting them from doing unfair or deceptive acts or practices** in connection with the collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal information.

### Company responsibilities

They need to have a **privacy policy** listing the following:

- All **third parties** collecting children's personal information, e.g. social platform plug-ins, ad networks, etc.
- Description of **what personal information** is collected, and **how it's used**.

### Children's rights (in a digital world)

If you work for kids (as a target group) you need to know about their rights.

### UX for Teens

How do children look at **trust and credibility**?

How do children look at **Search and information finding**?

How do children look at **disclosing private info**?

- Kids (3-12): Credibility is less important because their goal is mainly entertainment.
- Teens (12-17): Difficulty judging credibility.
- Adults (18+): Quick to judge. Older adults are less critical about websites than younger adults.

### [Micropedia](https://www.themicropedia.org/#/) for micro-aggressions

#### What are micro-aggressions

Micro-aggressions are every day **snubs and insults** that marginalised groups face. (Micropedia)

> **Subtle comments** or actions that come from implicit **bias and/or stereotypes**.

- They might seem like compliments "You're beautiful for a transgender girl".
- A harmless comment "Where are you really from?".
- A subconscious action: crossing the street to avoid a racialised person.

#### How to avoid it

- Take the time to **think first**. _Micro-aggressions are so subtle, you often don't realise you're about to cause one but that doesn't mean you can't prevent them_.
- **Pause** for a moment.
- **Question** what you want to say/do and why.
- **Reframe your thoughts** on the bias you discovered through your questioning.

### Intigrate inclusion from the biginning

- When defining your user group: don't exclude anyone because of limitations, difficulties,...
- When defining your participants for primary research.
- When defining questions.
- When defining suggestions or advice.
