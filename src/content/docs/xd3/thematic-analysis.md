## Qualitative research analytics

To find patterns and themes in **information chaos** that represent the most **interesting aspects** of your data and that you can use for a basis for **personas, user scenarios and design choices**.

### Criteria

- **Durability**: If the research would be repeated > it would lead to similar results. The road to the result is transparent and well documented.
- **Credibility**: The research results are recognisable for the participants or target audience.

### Is it subjective

You, as a researcher are an essential part of the result. It is **you who reflects on the data**. It is you, as a researcher, that sees the patterns and formulates insights. **Your subjectivity is part of the analysis**.

- A critical attitude is essential: let your work be read by peers. Take a step back at moments to reflect.
- Reflect back to your main research question often during the process. Are you still answering the question?
- Do the same in quantitative research.
